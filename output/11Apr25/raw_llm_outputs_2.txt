An ultrasound examination of the wife is done which can be done on any day of the menstrual cycle. However, to assess the number of eggs in the ovary, the USG examination is preferably done on the 2nd or 3rd day of the cycle. IVF procedure comprises of 5 vital steps:",
    "ivf_protocol": "When the follicles reach the required size, the lady is given the last injection called trigger injection for the final maturation of the developing eggs. This injection needs to be injected at a specific time, usually at night, as it initiates a series of changes in the eggs and then the eggs must be taken out of the body within an exact time frame, usually 34 to 36 hours after this injection. Step 2: Ovuim pick up (tauting ovum pick up). The eggs are aspirated out of the body using an ovum pick-up needle. For the ovum pick-up procedure, the lady is under short general anesthesia for around 15 to 20 minutes. Around the same time, the husband is asked to provide sperms to prepare embryos. Sperm freezing is used when the male partner is away or not able to provide a semen sample on the day of egg retrieval. This procedure is a daycare procedure and the lady is kept under observation till she regains full consciousness and is ready to walk out of the hospital. Step 3: Create the embryo (cultured in IVF lab for 2-5 days). The collected eggs and sperms will be transferred to the Embryology laboratory for fertilization. Embryos are cultured in the IVF lab for 2-5 days. If the embryos are transferred into the utorus in the same cycle in which eggs are retrieved, it is called fresh embryo transfer. In frozen embryo transfer cycle, good quality embryos are frozen and the transfer is done at a later date. Frozen embryo transfer has a better success rate than fresh embryo transfer as the elevated hormones resulting from ovarian stimulation come back to normal levels once the current menstrual cycle is over. Medicines are then prescribed by the doctor to prepare her utorus to receive the pregnancy. Frozen embryos are first brought back to life by the process known as thawing of embryos and then transferred when the utorus is adequaelly prepared.
